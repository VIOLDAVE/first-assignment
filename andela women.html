INTRODUCTION_TO_PROGRAMMING
</h1>

    <p>
     Programming is the art of writing computer programs. A computer requires instructions for it to execute any task.</p>  
<p><ul><li>computer program is a set of step by step instructions that a computer follows to a given task. 
Programming involves breaking down a task into small steps. In programming, we study the problem at hand, look for the solution to the problem and implement that solution using a particular programming language.</li>
<li>Computer programs may be categorized along functional lines: system software and application software. And many computer programs may run simultaneously on a single computer. This is called multitasking. </li>
  </p>
</ul>
</section>



 <section class="main-section" id="OVERVIEW_OF_PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGES">
<h1><b>OVERVIEW_OF_PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGES </b></h1>
<p>A programming language is a notation for writing computer programs which are specifications of a computation or algor </p> 
<p> can also be referred to as a software that allows a user to write a series of instructions to define a particular task, which will then be translated to a form that is understood by the computer. They are a means of communicating with the processor. </p>
<ul><li> A programming language is a language that a computer can understand </li>
<li> It provides a programmer an environment to write and execute programs.</li>
 <li>A number of programming languages exist but the choice mainly depends on the nature of the problem at hand and the programmer’s ability to use the language. </li>
Programming Languages are broadly categorized into two ie </ul>
 <b>Low level language </b>
 <b> High level language</b> 
<p>
</section>




    <section class="main-section" id="Low_Level_language"> 
<h1>
    <b> Low_Level_language (LLL)</b>
</h1>
<p>These are low-level languages because they are closely associated with processor than high-level language, which are near to the programmers. For 
instance programmers are required to write all program instructions in the 0s and 1s of binary code and to specify storage locations for every instruction and item of data used. There are two types of low-level language </p>
 <ol><li>Machine language/code</li> 
<li> Assembly language/code </li>
<li>Machine Language</li> </ol>
<p>It is also referred to as 1st generation language and difficult to learn and not user friendly to humans. Programming in machine code is very tiresome and very many errors are likely to occur. Instructions are in 0s and 1s   in binary format for example 16 byte machine = 1010000000001001. 
Advantages of machine code language </p>
<p>Programming in this particular language is done at the level which the computer understands thus no needs of using a language translators. </p>
<b>Disadvantages machine code language</b>
<ol><LI> Tiresome </LI>
<li> Subjected to a number of errors </li>
<li> It is not easily understood by user</li> 
<li>High volume of work hence time consuming</li> <li>It is very difficult to transfer programs from one computer to another, since the language depends on a particular machine, which has its own language code. 
Assembly language </li>
</ol>

<p>These are 2nd generation languages designed for specific machine and specific processors. It is easily understood and remembered by human because it makes use of certain mnemonics e.g. sub for subtraction, sum for adding up etc. It cannot be easily transferred from one computer to another since different manufacturers produce different processors, which identify and locate memory (ies) and registers differently.</p>

 <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
<h1>
<b>Declaring_Variables</b> 
</h1>
<p>Managing Variables Variables are like mail boxes in the post office. The contents of the variables change every now and then, just like the mail boxes. In term of VB2008, variables are areas allocated by the computer memory to hold data. Like the mail boxes, each variable must be given a name. To name a variable in Visual Basic 2008, you have to follow a set of rules. Variable Names The following are the rules when naming the variables in Visual Basic 2008 </p>
    <ul><li> must be less than 255 characters  No spacing is allowed</li></ul> 
    <p>Declaring Variables In Visual Basic 2008, you need to declare the variables before you can use them by assigning names and data types. If you fail to do so, the program will show an error. They are normally declared in the general section of the codes' windows using the Dim statement.</p>
    <p> The syntax is;</p>
    <ul><li> Dim Variable Name As Data Type  Examples are; Dim password As String Dim yourName As String </li>
        <li>Dim firstnum As Integer</li>
        <li> Dim secondnum As Integer</li>
        <li> Dim total As Integer</li>
        <li> Dim doDate As Date </li></ul>

   <p> You may also combine them in one line, separating each variable with a comma, as follows: Dim password As String, yourName As String, firstnum As Integer, etc.............</p>
</section>




<section class="main-section" id="Working_with_Data_types_and_variables"> >
<h1> Working with Data types and Variables</h1>
    
    <p> We come across many types of information and data in our daily life. For example, we need to handle data such as names, addresses, money, date, stock quotes, statistics and more every day.</p> 
    <p>Similarly in Visual Basic 2008, we have to deal with all sorts of data, some can be mathematically calculated while some are in the form of text or other forms.</p>
     <p>VB2008 divides data into different types so that it is easier to manage when we need to write the code involving those data. Visual Basic 2008 Data Types Visual Basic classifies the aforementioned information into two major data types, they are the numeric data types and the non-numeric data types. </p>
<p> Numeric Data Types Numeric data types are types of data that comprise numbers, which we can process mathematically using various standard arithmetic operators.</p> 
<ul>
Examples of numeric data types are
<li>Examination marks.</li>
<li>Body height, and body weight.</li>
<li>The number of students in a class</li>
<li>Share values</li>
<li>Prices of goods</li>
<li>Monthly bills</li> 
<p>Visual Basic 2008 divides numeric data into seven types, depending on the range of values they can store. Calculations that only involve round figures or data that do not need precision can use Integer or Long integer in the computation.</p>
<p> Programs that require high precision calculation need to use Single and Double data types, they are also called floating-point numbers. For currency calculation, you can use the currency data types.</p>
<p>Lastly, if even more precision is required to perform calculations that involve a many decimal points, we can use the decimal data types. 
   </p>
</ul>

 <section class="main-section" id="Visual_basic_operators"> >
<h1> VISUAL_BASIC_OPERATORS</h1>
    <p><b>Mathematical /Arithmetic Operators</b></p>
 <P>Computers can perform mathematical calculations much faster than human beings do. However, computer itself is not able to perform any mathematical calculations without receiving instructions from the programmer or user.</P>
  <p>In VB2008, we can write code to instruct the computer to perform mathematical calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and other kinds of arithmetic operations. In order for VB2008 to carry out arithmetic calculations, we need to write code that involves the use of various arithmetic operators. VB2008 arithmetic operators are very similar to the normal arithmetic operators, only witssh slight variations. The plus and minus operators are the same while the multiplication operator use the * symbol and the division operator use the / symbol. The list of VB2008 arithmetic operators are shown in table 7-1 below: </p>

 <section class="main-section" id="constants">
<h1>Constants</h1>
<p>
    Objects in the system interact with each other  through exchange of messages to fulfill a system functionality </p>
 
<p>We use Interaction Diagrams….; </p> 
<ul> 
<li>They typically capture the behavior in a single use case</li> 
 
<li>A set of messages exchanged among a set of objects to accomplish a purpose.</li> 
 
<header>The purpose of Interaction diagrams </header>
 
<li>Model interactions between objects </li>
<li>Assist in understanding how a system (a use case) actually works Verify that a use case description can be supported by the existing classes </li>
<p>In UML, there are basically two interaction diagrams ie; </p> 
 
<li>Sequence Diagram: Emphasize the timing and flow of messages among the objects </li>
 
<li>Collaboration Diagrams: Emphasizes structural relations between objects </li>
<b>Sequence Diagrams </b>

<p>Illustrates how objects interact with each other.
 <li>Emphasizes time ordering of messages.</li>
  <li>Can model simple sequential flow, branching, iteration, recursion and concurrency</li>   
</p>
</ul>
</section>



<section class="main-section" id="Data_types"> >
<h1>Data_types</h1>
 <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
<b>Six data types that are primitives</b>
<ul>
    <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
<li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
<li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
<li>String. "Howdy"</li>
<li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li> 
<li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.
and Object</li>
<p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.
 </p>
</ul>
</section>


<section class="main-section" id="logical_operatos">
<h1>
    Logical operators
</h1>
    <p>The logical operators compare Boolean expressions and return a Boolean result. </p>
       <p> The “And” and “Or” operators take two operands, </p>
         <p>The Not operator takes a single operand. </p>
         <p>The Logical And: operator returns a True if both operands are True. Else, it returns a False. </p>
         <p>The And operator performs logical conjunction on two Boolean expressions. That is, if both expressions evaluate to True, then the And operator returns True. If either or both expressions evaluate to False, then And returns False.  Example; Dim a, b as Boolean a = 23 > 14 And 11 > 8  (True)     (1 And 1 =True) b = 14 > 23 And 11 > 8  ( False)   (0 And 1 =False) ' The preceding statements set a to True and b to False. </p>
         <p>The Logical Or: returns a True if either of its operands is True, else it returns a False. The Or operator performs logical disjunction on two Boolean expressions.</p>
        <P>If either expression evaluates to True, Or returns True. If neither expression evaluates to True, Or returns False.  Example Dim c,d as Boolean c = 23 > 14 Or 8 > 11  (true)   (1 or 0 =true) d = 23 > 67 Or 8 > 11  (false)  (0 or 0 = false) ' The preceding statements set c to True and d to False </p>
</section>




 <section class="main-section" id="while_statement"> 
<h1>while_statement</h1>
 <p> A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows: 
while (condition)</p>
 statement
<p>If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop. </p>
<p>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following while.</p>
To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.
Example: 
The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:<br>
<code>var n = 0;
var x = 0;
    while (n < 3) 
      n++;
      x += n;
    }
</code>
<p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:</p>
After the first pass:<br>
<code> n = 1 and x = 1
After the second pass:n = 2 and x = 3
After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</code>
After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.

<h1>Object_Technology</h1>
 <P>A set of principles (abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism) guiding software construction, together with languages, databases, and other tools that support those principles.  •It is used for creating models that reflect a specific domain using the terminology of the domain….software, architectural engineering etc</P> 
 
 <p>This approach depicts the real world and solves problems through the interpretation of “objects”, digitally mimicking and representing the tangible elements of a system.  •It considers a system as a dynamic entity comprising of components, which can only be defined with respect to one another. •What a system is and does can be described only in terms of its components and how they interact. </p>
 
<ul><li>Facts about Object Technology •Models created using object technology are easy to create, change, expand, validate, and verify. Systems are flexible to change, have welldefined architectures, and have the opportunity to create and implement reusable components.</li>
  <li>Models are implemented using any objectoriented programming languages.  •It is used in a large number of projects and for building many types of systems</li>
<b>The Strengths of Object Technology</b> 
 
<li>Reflects a single paradigm.</li>
<li> It provides a consistent language that can be applied for both system and business engineering.</li> <li>Facilitates architectural and code reuse </li>
<li>Reflects real world models more closely. Is more stable, a change to the system can be localized to a small part of the system.</li>
<li>Is adaptive to change -a small change in requirements does not mean massive changes to the system. </li>
